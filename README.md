## Questions that nobody asks

### Why 4 operating systems?

I like BSD systems and I actively use them daily. However, not everything run
well on BSDs (i.e ipts on my Surface, unported libraries/software).

Windows 10 is there for games and other shitty software that doesn't exist on
Linux nor BSDs.

Manjaro Linux is there if I need a serious "work environment" but still require
shitty software or libraries.

If I have a choice, I would only have BSDs on both my laptop and my desktop.

## Why do you care about running BSDs?

Because, I like them. They have a saner environment than Linux and overall,
a better community.

I also use BSDs at work and on production machines so I would prefer to eat my
own dog food daily (unlike some people who I wouldn't name here).

## Why do you stop using window managers and DIY your desktop?

While I like the flexibility, I would like to put myself into the
shoes of a "normal user" and suffer the same fate as them.

They may not have the technical capabilites to setup window managers
and scour endless documentation just to configure small stuff like
compositors and friends.

After all, if we recommend people to come and join us in the world of
open source software, aren't we obliged to at least eat our own
dogfood and suffer together?

## Why not Wayland because Wayland is better for touch device and blahblah...?

I would prefer to use something that always work (even with its very rough
edges) rather than something that breaks most of the time.

## Emacs, seriously?

See above.

## Firefox, seriously? Chrome have better devtools!

I don't give a shit and see above.
