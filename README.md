## Questions that nobody asks

### Why 4 operating systems?

I like BSD systems and I actively use them daily. However, not everything run
well on BSDs (i.e ipts on my Surface, unported libraries/software).

Windows 10 is there for games and other shitty software that doesn't exist on
Linux.

Arch Linux is there if I need a serious "work environment" but still require
shitty software or libraries.

If I have a choice, I would only have HardenedBSD on my desktop and only OpenBSD
on my laptop.

## Doesn't OpenBSD run OK on the surface?

Yeah, it does but the reason why is simply I bought this surface is to be a
portable machine for school that means running shitty software (like JavaFX) and
taking notes or drawing penises.

## Why do you care about running BSDs?

Because, I like them. They have a saner environment than Linux and overall,
a better community.

I also use BSDs at work and on production machines so I would prefer to eat my
own dog food daily (unlike some people who I wouldn't name here).

## Why not Wayland because Wayland is better for touch device and blahblah...?

I would prefer to use something that always work (even with its very rough
edges) rather than something that breaks most of the time.

## XTerm, seriously?

See above.

## Emacs, seriously?

See above.

## xlock, seriously?

See above.

## xidle, seriously?

See above.

## Firefox, seriously? Chrome have better devtools!

I don't give a shit and see above.
